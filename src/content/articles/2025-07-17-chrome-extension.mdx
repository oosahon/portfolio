If you've ever wanted to build a Chrome Extension but don't know where to start, this series is for you. I will walk you through the concepts of a Chrome Extension -- service workers, content script, communication within a Chrome Extension and more.

Let's jump right into it!

Before I take you through the concepts of a Chrome Extension, I would like us to create our very first extension: a simple extension that displays "Hello, world" when you open a new tab.

<Callout variant="success">
	**What you will learn** - Declaring a Chrome Extension using a `manifest.json` file - Loading an
	unpacked extension in dev mode.
</Callout>

If you've ever built a web application, you would may know about `package.json` or `pyproject` if you are coming from Python. Notwithstanding, a `manifest.json` simply describes the properties of a Chrome Extension. We will see more of it later, but for now, let's describe our simple Chrome extension that prints "Hello, world."

Create a new project and name it whatever you like. I will name mine `my-extension`.

Inside that project, create a manifest.json file and paste the following:

```json
{
	"manifest_version": 3,
	"name": "New Tab Extension",
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"description": "A simple extension that changes the content of a Chrome tab."
}
```

Let's go over each property:

- `manifest_version` (required): specifies the manifest's version. 3 is the latest version. So, you should always use this as earlier versions have been deprecated.
- `name` (required): the name of your extension as it will appear in the Chrome Web Store and in the Extensions page.
- `version` (required): the version of your extension, following semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Learn more about versioning [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest/version)
- `description` (optional): a brief description of your extension's functionality.

And there you have it...your very own Chrome Extension. Yes, it does not do anything now, but it's a Chrome Extension nonetheless.

Now, let's load this on the browser.

Our Chrome extension has been loaded, but it currently does nothing.

Let's print "Hello, world when you open a new tab.

Update your `manifest.json` like so:

```json
{
	"manifest_version": 3,
	"name": "New Tab Extension",
	"version": "0.1.0",
	"description": "A simple extension that changes the content of a Chrome tab.",
	"chrome_url_overrides": {
		// [!code ++]
		"newtab": "newtab.html" // [!code ++]
	} // [!code ++]
}
```

Create a new file called `newtab.html` and add the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<title>Hello World</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello World</h1>
	</body>
</html>
```

Now, reload your extension in the Chrome Extensions page.

When you open a new tab, you should see "Hello World" displayed!

	<source src="/2025-07-17-chrome-extension-hello-world.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
	Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

üéâ Congratulations! You‚Äôve just built and loaded your first Chrome Extension. It may be simple, but this ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù lays the foundation for everything that comes next.

In the next part, we‚Äôll dive into the real engine of Chrome Extensions (Service Workers and Content Scripts), the tools that bring interactivity, automation, and power to your extension.

Let‚Äôs go from ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù to something truly useful. See you in Part 2!

description: "The courage of the Philistines, often seen as villains, offers a surprising lesson in strength and resolve. This reflection on 1 Samuel shows how even unlikely figures can inspire us to face life’s battles with boldness, perspective, and a touch of humour when things fall apart.

The Bible is laden with stories of heroism: David, Elisha, Daniel, and others set precedent for faith, valour and bravery. It is not abnormal to seek these stories when you feel you lack some virtues needed to scale through life’s troubles. Today, I was in search of precisely that.

For no particular reason, I decided to read through the first book of Samuel. And like I had anticipated, I was inspired. What I didn’t foresee, however, was the source of the inspiration — the Philistines, the supposed villains.

For some weird reason, the Jews and Philistines were constantly at war. What they fought over was not explicitly stated most time. Before David took Uriah’s wife to bed, for example, it was stated that it was “at the time when kings go forth to battle” (2 Samuel 11:1). I find that a bit strange. Did these guys have a battle timetable? Maybe their conversations went like this:

**King David**: “Why don’t we make time for battle?”

**King of the Philistines**: “Great suggestion. It’s been a boring year. Spring seems nice.”

I digress…

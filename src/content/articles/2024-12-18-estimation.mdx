This week, we will be looking into a crucial but often overlooked aspect of software engineering ‚Äì the art of estimation. Unlike our usual deep dives into front-end engineering, today we delve into a soft skill that is, if not more, equally vital in our ever-evolving field.  

By the end of this newsletter, you will have a more systematic approach to providing estimates for your tasks, one rooted in data rather than relying on gut feelings.  

<Tldr>
Employ the three-point estimation techniques when providing task estimates. This technique uses the following formula:

$$
 E = (O + 4M + P)/6
$$

Where:

`E` is the expected estimate

`O` is the optimistic estimate

`M` is the most likely estimate

`P` is the pessimistic estimate
</Tldr>

### The Challenge

As a Software Engineer, a lot of the things you would be involved in giving estimates, a lot of it. However, like many engineers, I had never sought a systematic way of providing estimates. Most estimates were determined by gut feeling or, worse, based on optimism or pessimism.  

A couple of weeks ago, I asked for ‚ÄúOne more day‚Äù one too many times. It was a terrible way to manage stakeholders‚Äô expectations. Also, it did not give the impression that I was in control of the situation. This inability to not grossly underestimate or overestimate tasks also affects the way we set personal goals.  

So, what did I do when I got frustrated from asking for an additional day one too many times? I sought advice from my engineering manager, who suggested several techniques, but I will share the one that stood out.

### The Solution
There are multiple project estimation techniques that you can use for a task (see [Six Techniques for Project Planning](https://asana.com/resources/estimation-methods)).

As I mentioned earlier, one technique caught my attention ‚Äî the three-point estimation technique. The expected estimate is the average of three estimates ‚Äî the optimistic estimate, the most likely estimate and the pessimistic estimate. So, assuming you are asked to implement a file viewer component with panning, zooming and all that fun stuff without a third-party library.  

Your optimistic, most likely and pessimistic might be 2, 6 and 13 days, respectively. The average of this would be 7 days.  

This could be represented with the formula:  

$$
 E = (O + 4M + P)/6
$$

Where:

`E` is the expected estimate

`O` is the optimistic estimate

`M` is the most likely estimate

`P` is the pessimistic estimate

If you paid attention to the formula in the tl;dr section, you would notice it is different to this. So, the question is, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù  

This is called the Simple Mean or Triangular Estimate. The other formula (the one in the tl;dr section) is the more commonly used technique, and it is called the Weighted or Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT).  

The idea of the PERT is to give more ‚Äúweight‚Äù to the most likely estimate by multiplying it by 4. So, the expected estimate becomes the average of:  

$$
O + M + M + M + M + P
$$

So our new formula becomes:  

$$
E = (O + M + M + M + M + P)/6
$$

or

$$
E = (O + 4M + P)/6
$$


Your next question might be, "Why ‚Äò4‚Äô and not some arbitrary number like 10?"  

While the choice of 4 might seem arbitrary without this context, it is based on statistical modelling assumptions and provides reasonable estimates for a wide range of project scenarios. ([Learn more here.](http://deepfriedbrainproject.com/2010/07/pert-formula.html))  

### Conclusion
In this edition of What I Learnt Last Week, I discussed software engineers' challenges when estimating projects. I introduced the three-point estimation technique as a solution to this problem.  

I also stated that the number 4 in the `PERT` formula is based on probability theory to achieve balanced and reliable estimation.  

I hope this helps you with your future estimations and ‚Äúguesstimations.‚Äù Happy estimating! üéâ
